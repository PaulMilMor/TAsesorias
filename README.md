## Deployment

The Angular Sample App can be easily deployed to [GitHub Pages](#github-pages), or [another static web hosting service](#other-static-web-hosting), like an AWS S3 bucket.

### GitHub Pages

1. Create a repo on [GitHub](https://github.com).

1. Add the remote to your project:

   `$ git remote add origin GITHUB_URL/GITHUB_USERNAME/GITHUB_REPO_NAME.git`

1. Open the `angular.json` file and on line 48 replace `/` with your GitHub repo name surrounded by slashes like this: `/GITHUB_REPO_NAME/`.

1. Build your project:

   `$ ng build --prod`

1. Git add, commit, and push your project:

   `$ git add -A`

   `$ git commit -m "deploying to github"`

   `$ git push origin master`

1. On GitHub, in your repo, navigate to the "settings" page, scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section, and choose the "master branch /docs folder" for the source.

1. Now your project will be deployed to https://GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/GITHUB_REPO_NAME.

### Other Static Web Hosting

1. Build your project:

   `$ ng build --prod`

1. Deploy the complied `/docs` directory to a static web hosting service, like an AWS S3 bucket.
